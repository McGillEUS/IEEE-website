We are inviting all robotic enthusiasts to join us in this exciting event and compete for the grand prize!\n\nPrior to competition day, your team will design and program an autonomous robot (without any external control or guidance) that can compete with other robots within a limited zone. The goal is to push your opponent's robot out of the arena while staying in the arena yourself. The team with the last robot standing wins!\n\n## Prizes\n- TBA\n\n## Opportunities\nThis competition is a great opportunity for you to showcase your engineering skills and gain experience in the field of robotics. You will have the chance to meet and network with other robotic enthusiasts and professionals in Montreal within the competitive ambiance.\n\n## Details & Announcements\nDetails about the competition will be announced soon on IEEE Concordia website and social media pages.
