## Description
Looking to make your CV stand out for those future internships or just to learn more about the different computer hardware The Factory has to offer? Then our makeathon is the perfect opportunity for you!

ðŸ¤– Form a team of four people (or we can assign you to one!) and join us on Saturday and Sunday, January 20 to 21st, where your main objective will be to build robot to perform a specific task! All material will be provided, you only need yourself! Think you're a master robot builder? Apply to this makeathon for a chance to win some great prizes!

Additionally, there will be an optional Arduino workshop hosted by The Factory right after opening ceremonies for those interested!
