## About
Every year, IEEE members from IEEE Sections, Student Branches, Affinity groups, and Society Chapters join hands to celebrate IEEE Day. IEEE Day commemorates the anniversary of the first time when IEEE members gathered to share their technical ideas, which took place in 1884. The first IEEE Day took place in 2009 with 80 events around the world. 

After almost two years of holding the IEEE Day celebration virtually, we are pleased to announce that this year we will hold this event in person. We want everyone in the IEEE Montreal community to come to our event and meet members from the section, including the executive team of IEEE McGill 2022/2023. The celebrations take place on Tuesaday October 4th at 5PM at Concordia University. Admission is FREE upon registration, so go ahead and reserve your seat right now at the link below!
